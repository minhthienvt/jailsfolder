# Jails

This gem is for learning purposes only. It is the companion to the tutorial Build Your Own Rails. Full explanation of the code in this gem and how to use it with a web application are at:
https://www.techandstartup.org/tutorials/build-your-own-rails
This is a very simplified Web framework using the Model View Controller architecture, following as much of the feel of Rails as possible while keeping it very simple. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jails

## Usage

This Gem is for learning purposes only and it is not meant to be used for a real project. 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
