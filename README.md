# Jailsfolder - Jails MVC Web Framework and Blog App

This is the source code for the Build Your Own Rails tutorial. 

The tutorial with detailed instructions on how to build this is at: 

https://www.techandstartup.com/tutorials/build-your-own-rails

This is for teaching purposes only. 

There are three separate folders.

1) The rackapp folder which holds the simple rack application from part 1 of the tutorial.

2) The Jails folder contains a simple MVC Web framework in Ruby, for building RESTful Web applications. Again, this is not for use in production. 

3) The Blog folder contains a sample Web app that uses the Jails framework.
